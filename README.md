# MIDSProjects

This repository contains projects that highlight my body of work in the UC Berkeley's Master of Information and Data Science Program.  The program was completed from May 2018 to May 2020.

The projects are organized by the programming language (Python, R).  In the table below, you will find a brief description of every project, what is included, and whether a project required individual effort or group effort.  For group projects, I have also included notes on my specific contribution.

|Project Name|Description|Individual or Group|My Specific Contribution|
|---|---|---|---|
|2DEscapeTheRoom|This project is the most complete and clear representation of object oriented programming using Python. The 2DEscapeTheRoom.py file is a playble game in Terminal, provided you have Python 3. I have also included a video (2DEscapeTheRoomGameplay.mp4), which shows me testing the game I created.|Individual||
