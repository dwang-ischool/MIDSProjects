This repository contains all major projects that I completed in my pursuit of the Master of Information and Data Science degree from the University of California, Berkeley. The links lead to subfolders that include source code and at least one file, either PDF or Jupyter Notebook, that contains a final report with code, analysis and results.  Group projects can be distinguished by those with multiple authors in the final report.  

Other than the Capstone, all projects done in my courses are in this repository and accesible through the tables of contents in the sections below. 

## Capstone

The Captone is a large group project that was completed over the course of our final semester.  Our capstone focused on building a complete product that can:
- collect patients' responses regarding vaccination sentiment through a questionnaire chatbot
- detect reasons for vaccination hesitation or specific anti-vaccine sentiment using a supervised learning NLP model
- report a summary of patient's vaccine concerns to heathcare providers via an interactive dashboard

Our Capstone has its own public [repository](https://github.com/dwang-ischool/Jonas) and [website](https://jonasassessment.wixsite.com/jonas/).  While we are not currently supporting our product and features are not operational, you can still watch this [demo](https://jonasassessment.wixsite.com/jonas/demo) of how our product functioned at the time of completion.

## Python 

|Project Name|Description|
|---|---|
|||
|[2D Escape The Room](https://github.com/dwang-ischool/MIDSProjects/tree/master/Python/2DEscapeTheRoom)|This project is the most complete representation of object oriented programming using Python. A game which I designed end-to-end, the 2DEscapeTheRoom.py file is a playble in Terminal (using Python 3), and allows you to escape from 1-4 rooms. I have also included a video (2DEscapeTheRoomGameplay.mp4), which shows me playing the entire game.|
|[Bechdel Test EDA](https://github.com/dwang-ischool/MIDSProjects/tree/master/Python/BechdelTestEDA)|An exploratory data analysis of films found on IMDB and their Bechdel Test Scores, a score given to movies based on the level of female character interation.  We use Python, predominately NumPy and Pandas, to examine if any correlations exist between Bechdel Test Scores and factors such as movie genres, runtime, IMDB ratings, time of film release, bankability of films and the bankability of actors and actresses|
|[Bike Share Recommendations](https://github.com/dwang-ischool/MIDSProjects/tree/master/Python/BikeShareRecommendations)|Using a combination of Python and SQL, I obtained data from Google Bigquery's publically accessble data set of bike share activities of a company based in San Francisco.  Data analysis was conducted to produce recommendations for how the company may be able to increase business revenue|
|[Forest Cover Classification Prediction](https://github.com/dwang-ischool/MIDSProjects/tree/master/Python/ForestCoverClassificationEnsemble)|This project attempts to find the best prediction algorithm for forest coverage identification given 7 classifications.  More information for the origin of the data can be found at this [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-prediction).  We used various machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine(SVM), Decision Tree, and Random Forest, in order to maximize the accuracy of predictions on forest coverage classification|
|[Click Through Rate Prediction](https://github.com/dwang-ischool/MIDSProjects/tree/master/Python/ClickThroughRatePrediction)|Using Python and Spark, we developed a distributed Logistic Regression algorithm to predict Click Through Rate on a large data set (45 million data points).  The scalability of the algorithm relies on parallelized Gradient Descent which attempts to optimize the model through log-loss minimization|
|[Assorted Machine Learning Work](https://github.com/dwang-ischool/MIDSProjects/tree/master/Python/AssortedMachineLearningWork)|This directory contains selected works solving various problems using Machine Learning Algorithms.  The [MachineLearningUsingSKLearn](https://github.com/dwang-ischool/MIDSProjects/tree/master/Python/AssortedMachineLearningWork/MachineLearningUsingSKLearn) folder contains projects that use python package scikit-learn to produce prediction results. Project objectives include using k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and Naive Bayes to for [digit classification from handwriting](https://github.com/dwang-ischool/MIDSProjects/tree/master/Python/AssortedMachineLearningWork/MachineLearningUsingSKLearn/KNNandNaiveBayesDigitClassification), using Logistic Regression to [predict topic labels for natural language data](https://github.com/dwang-ischool/MIDSProjects/blob/master/Python/AssortedMachineLearningWork/MachineLearningUsingSKLearn/SimpleNLPTopicClassification) processed through CountVectorizor and TFIDF, and using GMM and PCA to [classify poisonous mushrooms](https://github.com/dwang-ischool/MIDSProjects/tree/master/Python/AssortedMachineLearningWork/MachineLearningUsingSKLearn/PCA%2BGMM_MushroomClassification).  The [ScalableMachineLearning](https://github.com/dwang-ischool/MIDSProjects/tree/master/Python/AssortedMachineLearningWork/ScalableMachineLearning) folder includes examples of developing machine learning algorithms for large-scale data using distributed computation techniques.  These problems include [classifying spam emails](https://github.com/dwang-ischool/MIDSProjects/tree/master/Python/AssortedMachineLearningWork/ScalableMachineLearning/NaiveBayesInHadoop) using Naive Bayes and Hadoop, [finding synonyms amongst books](https://github.com/dwang-ischool/MIDSProjects/tree/master/Python/AssortedMachineLearningWork/ScalableMachineLearning/SynonymDetectionInSpark) using Cosine Similarity and Spark, [finding top visited sites](https://github.com/dwang-ischool/MIDSProjects/tree/master/Python/AssortedMachineLearningWork/ScalableMachineLearning/PageRankAlgorithm) using Page Rank algorithm based in distributed graph processing|

## R
|Project Name|Description|
|---|---|
|||
|[Broadband EDA](https://github.com/dwang-ischool/MIDSProjects/tree/master/R/BroadbandEDA)|This project examines the 3-way relationship between Price, Penetration and Speed of Broadband connectivity across 30 Countries using Linear Regression|
|[Crime Rate Linear Models](https://github.com/dwang-ischool/MIDSProjects/tree/master/R/ProbabilityLab)|This project explores relationships between between variables, such as population density, probability of arrest, probability of conviction, and police per capita, and their effects on Crime Rate in 1987 North Carolina across 90 counties.  We then designed a linear regression model of best fit to predict crime rate using measurements of fit (Adjusted R<sup>2</sup>, AIC), and testing of assumptions of Classical Linear Model (CLM) to justify which explanatory variables to include|
|[Impact of Gender on Technical Customer Service Rating Experiment](https://github.com/dwang-ischool/MIDSProjects/tree/master/R/GenderTechnicalCustomerServiceRatingExperiment)|This project attempts to assess causality between perceived gender indicators and customer service ratings of technical support agents.  We test the hypothesis that female support agents will receive lower ratings when giving identical level of support compared to male agents.  Data was collected through paid surveys, and potential causality was examined using Linear Regression and Randomization Inference|
|[Challenger O-ring Failure](https://github.com/dwang-ischool/MIDSProjects/blob/master/R/ChallengerOringFailure)|Using two types of Logistic Regression modeling techniques and data from previous space shuttle launches, we determine the likelihood of a single o-ring failure being the cause of the Space Shuttle Challenger tragedy|
|[E-commerce Retail Sales Prediction](https://github.com/dwang-ischool/MIDSProjects/tree/master/R/ECommerceRetailSalesPredictionSARIMA)|In this project, we find the best model for time series data of e-commerce retail sales.  We attempt polynomial Linear Regression models, and non-seasonal and seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models.  Our hyperparameter choices are determined by analysis of stationarity through autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions along with evaluation of fit measurements (AIC, AICc, BIC)|
|[Analysis of Traffic Fataility Rate](https://github.com/dwang-ischool/MIDSProjects/blob/master/R/DrivingFatalityPanelStudy/DrivingFatalityPanelStudy.pdf)|An exploration of panel data set on the factors that led to Traffic Fatalities decrease over time across states|
