# MIDSProjects

This repository contains projects that highlight my body of work in the UC Berkeley's Master of Information and Data Science Program.  The program was completed from May 2018 to May 2020.

The projects are organized by the programming language (Python, R).  In the table below, you will find a brief description of every project, what is included, and whether a project required individual effort or group effort.  For group projects, I have also included notes on my specific contribution. 

## Python 

|Project Name|Description|Individual or Group|My Contribution|
|---|---|---|---|
|[2DEscapeTheRoom](https://github.com/dwang-ischool/MIDSProjects/tree/master/Python/2DEscapeTheRoom)|This project is the most complete representation of object oriented programming using Python. A game which I designed end to end, the 2DEscapeTheRoom.py file is a playble in Terminal (using Python 3), and allows you to escape from 1-4 rooms. I have also included a video (2DEscapeTheRoomGameplay.mp4), which shows me playing the game.|Individual||
|[BechdelTestEDA](https://github.com/dwang-ischool/MIDSProjects/tree/master/Python/BechdelTestEDA)|An exploratory data analysis of films found on IMDB and their Bechdel Test Scores, a score given to movies based on the level of female character interation.  We use Python, predominately NumPy and pandas, to examine if any correlations exist between Bechdel Test Scores and factors such as movie genres, runtime, IMDB ratings, time of film release, bankability of films and the bankability of actors and actresses|Group|Pre-analysis data processing such as table joining, Analysis of Bechdel score correlation with movie genres, movie runtime and IMDB ratings, and bankability of top 50 films|
|[BikeShareRecommendations](https://github.com/dwang-ischool/MIDSProjects/tree/master/Python/BikeShareRecommendations)|Using a combination of Python and SQL, I obtained data from Google Bigquery's publically accessble data set of bike share activities of a company based in San Francisco.  Data analysis was conducted to produce recommendations for how the company may be able to increase business revenue|Individual||
|[ForestCoverClassificationEnsemble](https://github.com/dwang-ischool/MIDSProjects/tree/master/Python/ForestCoverClassificationEnsemble)|This project attempts to find the best prediction algorithm for forest coverage identification given 7 classifications.  More information for the origin of the data can be found at this [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/forest-cover-type-prediction).  We used various machine learning algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine(SVM), Decision Tree, and Random Forest, in order to maximize the accuracy of predictions on forest coverage classification|Group|Bivariate EDA, Data Transformation and Features selection, Full design of both Binary and Multinomial Naive Bayes Algorithms, Full design of GMM algorithm using Principal Component analysis, Compilation of all code|

## R
|Project Name|Description|Individual or Group|My Contribution|

|BroadbandEDA|This project examines the 3-way relationship between Price, Penetration and Speed of Broadband connectivity across 30 Countries. Both .rmd file of our code and pdf file of our report are included|Group|Univariate Analysis of Price per country, Bivriate Analysis of Price vs Speed, Analysis of 3-way tradeoff|
|ProbabilityLab|This laboratory exercise shows my detailed solutions for a series of problems in Probability (see full pdf file).  The 4th question uses R, with code included in the .rmd file|Individual||
|CrimeRateLinearModels|This project explores relationships between between variables, such as population density, probability of arrest, probability of conviction, and police per capita, and their effects on Crime Rate in 1987 North Carolina across 90 counties.  We then designed a linear regression model of best fit to predict crime rate using measurements of fit (Adjusted R<sup>2</sup>, AIC), and testing of assumptions of Classical Linear Model (CLM) to motivate which explanatory variables to include|Group|Model design and testing of various versions, analysis of variable inclusion based on fit and CLM assumptions|
