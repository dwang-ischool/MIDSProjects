# MIDSProjects

This repository contains projects that highlight my body of work in the UC Berkeley's Master of Information and Data Science Program.  The program was completed from May 2018 to May 2020.

The projects are organized by the programming language (Python, R).  In the table below, you will find a brief description of every project, what is included, and whether a project required individual effort or group effort.  For group projects, I have also included notes on my specific contribution. 

## Python 

|Project Name|Description|Individual or Group|My Specific Contribution|

|2DEscapeTheRoom|This project is the most complete and clear representation of object oriented programming using Python. The 2DEscapeTheRoom.py file is a playble game in Terminal, provided you have Python 3. I have also included a video (2DEscapeTheRoomGameplay.mp4), which shows me testing the game I created.|Individual||
|BechdelTestEDA|An exploratory data analysis of films found on IMDB and their Bechdel Test Scores, a score given to movies based on the level of female character interation.  We use Python, predominately NumPy and pandas, to examine if any correlations exist between Bechdel Test Scores and factors such as movie genres, runtime, IMDB ratings, time of film release, bankability of films and the bankability of actors and actresses.  Included are a series of disjoint Jupyter Notebooks, separated by my contributions and the notebooks from other members of my group.  For a detailed report of our analysis, please see the included PDF|Group|Pre-analysis data processing such as table joining, Analysis of Bechdel score correlation with movie genres, movie runtime and IMDB ratings, and bankability of top 50 films|
