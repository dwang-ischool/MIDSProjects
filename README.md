# MIDSProjects

This repository contains projects that highlight my body of work in the UC Berkeley's Master of Information and Data Science Program.  The program was completed from May 2018 to May 2020. In the tables below, you will find a brief description of every project, whether a project required individual effort or group effort, and my notes on my specific contribution for group projects.  The projects are split by programming languages, Python and R. 

## Python 

|Project Name|Description|Individual or Group|My Contribution|
|---|---|---|---|
|[2D Escape The Room](https://github.com/dwang-ischool/MIDSProjects/tree/master/Python/2DEscapeTheRoom)|This project is the most complete representation of object oriented programming using Python.
