    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

    "**ANSWER:**\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Nearest neighbors model relies on calculating the distance between each dev data and a set of n neighbors from the train data. The distance calculations depend on the features vectors of the training set and the dev set. The features vectors in this case are very long, since there are 26879 features or distinct words. As a result, nearest neighbors may still be relatively far distance wise, since the features vectors are too distinct from each other, which leads to poor accuracy of the predicted labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Naive Bayes assumes conditional independence of the features while logistic regression does not. In the Naive Bayes model, the vocabulary is treated as a bag of words where each word contributes to the label prediction probability independent from every other words. In the logistic regression model, words in the vocabulary are not conditionally indpendent, so label prediction probabilities depend on the joint frequency of multiple words. This lack of conditional independence leads to greater variance in the predictions of the logistic regression model, which in tern results in lower accuracies and precisions as reflected in the F1 scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. L2 regularization attempts to minimize the sum of squared weights. The C parameter signifies the inverse of the regularization strength. So as C increases, the regularization strength decreases and the sum of squared weights increases. As expected, we see in the output table above that sum of squared weights increases as C increase, or as regularization strength decreases."

Again, the \"the fbi\" being a freqent feature for talk.religion.misc is also interesting because it is unexpected that the fbi would appear so freqently in documents about religion."

The preprocessing function runs on the raw text, before it is split into words by the tokenizer. Your preprocessor should try to normalize the input in various ways to improve generalization. For example, try lowercasing everything, replacing sequences of numbers with a single token, removing various other non-letter characters, and shortening long words. If you're not already familiar with regular expressions for manipulating strings, see https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html, and re.sub() in particular.

    "**(6)** The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",

    "**ANSWER:**  The CountVectorizer gives every word in the same example equal weight, with a count of 1 if it appears and a count of 0 if it does not appear.  On the other hand, TfidfVectorizer weighs every word by the product of its term freqency and its inverse document-frequency (idf), where the idf for a word is a function of its freqency in the given document and the number of documents that contain the word.  The idf is inversely proportional to the number of documents, or other examples that contain the word. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dev data with values of R greater than 1 are wrongly predicted values.  The greater the value, the higher the max probability and/or the lower the predicted probability of the correct label.  For the dev data with top 3 R that I printed above, the first one of the 3 is too short, or as too few words, for the mistakes to be noticeable.  For the other 2 examples I printed, the mistake is that the content matches the dev label, but the document contains key words that match what one would expect to read for documents pertaining to predicted label, which is incorrect. For instance, for the second printed example, the document is \"Can anyone provide me a ftp site where I can obtain a online version of the Book of Mormon. Please email the internet address if possible\", where the incorretly predicted class of comp.graphics resulted from the key words \"ftp site\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the key words are the ones causing mistakes, we can reduce the mistakes by extracting features that have more context, thereby giving the context of the document greater weight in label prediction, rather than the individual words.  One way we can consider creating more contextual features is by changing the ngram_range parameter when creating the features vectors.  If we increase n to allow for only multiple word features, we may be able to lower the influence of key single words that cause mistaken predictions. "
